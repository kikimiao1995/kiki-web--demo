    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not </strong>closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend</li>

        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong> <em>Strong emphasised?</strong> what is this?</em>

                <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example:
                    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a>
                </li>
    </ul>
